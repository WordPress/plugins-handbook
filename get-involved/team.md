# The Team

The plugin review team is a group of volunteers who review and approve plugins newly submitted to be hosted on the official WordPress.org Plugin Directory. The team maintains the Plugin Reviewer Handbook and the official tools for reviewing plugins. The team also is responsible for investigating guideline infringements and behavioral issues surrounding plugins and developers throughout the WordPress.org community (including support forums, reviews, and WordCamps).

Our goal is to encourage and educate developers of all levels as to making the most secure and maintainable plugins available.

We can be contacted via [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) in [#pluginreview](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/pluginreview/) or email at `plugins@wordpress.org`.

The current team members are:

*   [Sam Wood (Otto42)](https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42) – Senior Administrator and Technical Ninja

Public discussion on plugins happens on [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat) in [#pluginreview](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C1LBM36LC). Team members should keep an eye on the channel and respond to community members' questions as they arise.

Announcements and topics for discussion are also posted on [make.wordpress.org/plugins](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins)

Weekly status reports are posted at [make.wordpress.org/updates/tags/plugins](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/tags/plugins)

A private P2 is used by the administrators to discuss sensitive information and record historical data as to why plugins or developers have restricted access. A private Slack channel is also used.

Emails are processed via Help Scout. Due to the sensitive nature of much of the information discussed, it also has limited access.
