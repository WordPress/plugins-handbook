# Get Involved

Everyone is encouraged to [join Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C1LBM36LC) and [follow the public blog](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/) to participate in any discussions there.

Whether or not you are a plugin reviewer, everyone is welcome to report plugins with security issues or ones that violate the plugin guidelines to the team. To do this, email `plugins@wordpress.org` with a descriptive subject line and a clear explanation of the issue. If youâ€™re reporting a security issue, please do your best to explain how someone can reproduce the issue. You can include screenshots or attach PDFs or zips if needed.

Keep in mind, _many_ email clients strip suspect content (even when sending) so code examples should be attached as ZIP files or PDFs.

Remember to test vulnerabilities as both an admin **and** an author (or lower), as some users have [elevated privileges when it comes to posting unfiltered html intentionally](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#why-are-some-users-allowed-to-post-unfiltered-html).

[Contributor Days](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/) at WordCamps are where a group of interested people can help review plugins. Alternately, we can go through the handbook and make edits and provide fixes.

Interested in getting more deeply involved by joining the Plugin Review team? Check out [the application process](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/apply/).
