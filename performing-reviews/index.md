# Performing Reviews

The bulk of the work done by the review team is actually reviewing new plugins. The steps taken to review a new plugin are actually the same as those for reviewing any existing plugin. The goal is to look for as much 'wrong' as possible, identify it clearly, and communicate that back to the developer.

All plugin reviews take the same form.

1. A plugin author is vetted to ensure they are not currently violating guidelines.
2. The plugin is downloaded and reviewed for subject matter, security, and quality.
3. The plugin is approved orâ€¦
4. The plugin is moved to 'pending', and an email is sent to the author with information re what to correct.
5. The author replies with the corrected code and the plugin is approved, or the email cycle continues (return to step 4).
